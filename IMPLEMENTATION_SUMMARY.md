# Klassic Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Type Class Implementation ✅
- **Problem**: Type class instances weren't being executed - they were just placeholders
- **Solution**: 
  - Extended `TypedAst.Program` to preserve instance declarations
  - Modified `VmInterpreter` to compile instance methods into executable functions
  - Instance methods are now registered as `ClassName_TypeName_methodName`
  - Each method is wrapped in a `NativeFunctionValue` that executes the compiled code

### 2. Pragmatic Language Features ✅
Previously implemented:
- **FileOutput module**: Write, append, delete files
- **Dir module**: List, create, copy, move directories  
- **Enhanced string functions**: split, join, trim, replace, etc.

## Current Test Status
- **Total**: 315 tests
- **Passing**: 306 tests
- **Failing**: 9 tests

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Type Classes with Record Types (1 failure)
- Structural vs nominal typing mismatch
- Instance for `Point` doesn't match `record { x: Int; y: Int; }`

### 2. Polymorphic Type Classes (3 failures)
- No support for type class constraints in function signatures
- Can't write: `def showList<'a>(xs: List<'a>) where Show<'a>`

### 3. Syntax Issues (2 failures)
- No boolean negation operator `!`
- Tests use unsupported syntax

### 4. Recursive Instance Methods (2 failures)
- Instance methods can't call themselves or other type class methods
- Would need proper dictionary passing

### 5. Higher-Kinded Type Classes (1 failure)
- Complex AST nodes like `RecordCall` not handled in method compilation

## Type Class Examples That Work

```klassic
typeclass Show<'a> where {
  show: ('a) => String
}

instance Show<Int> where {
  def show(x: Int): String = "Int: " + x
}

instance Show<String> where {
  def show(x: String): String = "String: " + x
}

show(42)         // "Int: 42"
show("hello")    // "String: hello"
```

## Architecture Notes

The type class implementation now follows this flow:
1. Parser creates AST with type class and instance declarations
2. Typer resolves type class method calls to `ClassName_TypeName_methodName` identifiers
3. VmInterpreter compiles instance method bodies and registers them as callable functions
4. Runtime lookups work through the standard environment chain

This is a working implementation for monomorphic type classes with concrete types.
