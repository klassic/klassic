# Type Class Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Basic Type Classes**: Can declare type classes with methods
   ```klassic
   typeclass Show<'a> where {
     show: ('a) => String
   }
   ```

2. **Instance Declarations**: Can define instances for concrete types
   ```klassic
   instance Show<Int> where {
     def show(x: Int): String = "Int: " + x
   }
   ```

3. **Direct Method Calls**: Type class methods work with concrete types
   ```klassic
   show(42)         // "Int: 42"
   show("hello")    // "String: hello"
   ```

4. **Multiple Type Classes**: Different type classes can coexist
   ```klassic
   equals(5, 5)     // true (from Eq type class)
   show(5)          // "Int: 5" (from Show type class)
   ```

## ❌ What's Not Working Yet

1. **Polymorphic Constraints**: Can't write generic functions with type class constraints
   ```klassic
   // This syntax doesn't exist yet:
   def showList<'a>(xs: List<'a>) where Show<'a> = ...
   ```

2. **Constraint Propagation**: Type class constraints aren't propagated through generic code

3. **Higher-Kinded Type Classes**: Advanced features like Functor/Monad

4. **Dictionary Passing**: No explicit dictionary passing mechanism

## Implementation Details

- Type class instances are compiled into callable functions at runtime
- Instance resolution is done by the Typer based on concrete types
- The VM Interpreter registers instance methods with names like `Show_Int_show`
- Instance method bodies are preserved through compilation via `instanceDeclarations` in TypedAst

## Test Results
- Before fix: 297/313 tests passing (16 failures)
- After fix: 307/315 tests passing (8 failures)
- Basic type class functionality is now working correctly
